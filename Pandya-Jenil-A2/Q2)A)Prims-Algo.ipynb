    "Prim's Algorithm Function (prim_mst): This function implements Prim's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters: The function takes a graph in adjacency matrix format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: We initialize several variables, including selected_node, mst_edges, edge_weight, and parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: We iterate over all the nodes to gradually build the MST by selecting the node with the smallest edge weight and updating the neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: For each node, we update the edge weights of its neighbors and store the result in mst_edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph as an Adjacency Matrix: The graph is represented as a matrix where the value at graph[i][j] represents the weight of the edge between nodes i and j. If there is no edge, it's represented by 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Execution: We call the prim_mst function and then print out the edges that make up the MST."
