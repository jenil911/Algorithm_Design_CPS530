    "### Q1. Merge Sort Implmentation\n",
    "Function Definition: merge_sort(arr) defines a function that sorts an array using the Merge Sort algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Case: The function checks if the array has more than one element; if not, it doesn't need sorting. Splitting the Array: The array is split into two halves, L (left) and R (right), using slicing. Recursive Sorting: The function calls itself on each half to sort them independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging Process: The two sorted halves are merged together by comparing the elements, ensuring that the merged result is sorted. Handling Leftovers: If any elements remain in one half after merging, they're added to the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Input: The user is asked to input a list of numbers separated by commas. Conversion: The input is split and converted into a list of integers. Sorting and Output: The MergeSort function is called on the input list, and the sorted result is printed."
